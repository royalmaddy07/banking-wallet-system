# 💳 BankEngine

A backend-focused **digital BankEngine system** designed with an emphasis on **data integrity, transactional correctness, and system design principles**.  
The project evolves from a standalone banking database design done in an earlier repo to a full backend service with authentication, business logic, and API-driven workflows.

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates the **core backend of a digital wallet / neobank system**, similar to those used in fintech platforms.  
It prioritizes correctness over UI, focusing on **ACID-compliant transactions**, **ledger-based accounting**, and **clean separation of concerns**.

The system was built in two phases:
1. **Banking Database Design** – normalized schema with strict constraints
2. **Backend Integration** – Django-based service layer on top of the schema

## 🏗️ Architecture
1. Standard Django based MVT architecture
